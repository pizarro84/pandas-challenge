# pandas-challenge
This repository contains Python codes in a Jupyter notebook that incorporates Pandas library to analyse CSV files. 

# PyCitySchools - Main Submission for the Homework
The folder contains a Jupiter Notebook file **PyCitySchools_Solved.ipynb**. The Notebook runs Python Code extensively utilising Pandas libraries to process School and Student data contained in two CSVs under the Resources folder. Executing each block of code will show the resulting data frame in tabular format. The Python logic runs analyses on school demographics such as school type, budget and number of students to identify patterns and trends in student performance.
